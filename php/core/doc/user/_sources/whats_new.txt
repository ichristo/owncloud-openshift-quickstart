What's New for Users in ownCloud 7
==================================

No More Shared Folder
---------------------

The Shared folder has been removed from ownCloud 7. If you are upgrading 
from older ownCloud versions you will still have your old Shared folder, 
but new shares will appear in the top-level of your Files page, and the Shared 
folder is no longer required. You can now create your own folders for 
storing shared files, and organize and move them around like any other files.

Selective Sync
--------------

The desktop client now makes it easier for users to configure which folders 
on their ownCloud instances should be syncing with the desktop, and can easily 
make changes for special circumstances such as travel and special projects.


Server to Server Sharing
------------------------

ownCloud 7 servers can now connect shares directly with each other. With just a 
few clicks you can easily and securely connect to public shares on other 
ownCloud servers, and optionally create public shares for sharing your own files 
if your admin allows it.

File and Activity Notifications
-------------------------------

In ownCloud 7 you can set up automatic notifications on your ownCloud 
Personal page of tracked activities such as new shares, and changed or deleted 
files.

ownCloud Documents with Word Conversion
---------------------------------------

You can convert Word documents on the fly: open them in ownCloud for 
editing, and live editing with other users, and when you close it reverts 
to its original Word format with all of your changes embedded. 


Mobile Web Browser Support
--------------------------

ownCloud 7 is friendly to small screens, and can be used on most tablet and 
mobile browsers without requiring the use of a native mobile app. This provides 
support for devices that do not have a native app, like Microsoft and
Blackberry.

Lazy Loading Files
------------------

Viewing your Files page is faster now thanks to "lazy loading", which loads 
files as you scroll down the page instead of loading all of them when you open 
the page.

Change in Share Expiration Date
-------------------------------

In older versions of ownCloud, you could set an expiration date on both local 
and public shares. Now you can set an expiration date only on public shares, 
and local shares do not expire when public shares expire. The only way to 
"expire" a local share is to click the trash can icon to un-share your files.
