Installation Wizard
-------------------

When ownCloud prerequisites are fulfilled and all ownCloud files are installed
on the server, the last thing left to do for finishing the installation is
running the Installation Wizard.

* Open your web browser
* Navigate to your ownCloud instance.

  * If you are installing ownCloud on the same machine as you are accessing the
    install wizard from, the url will be https://localhost/owncloud
  * If you are installing ownCloud on a different machine, you'll have to access
    it by its hostname or IP address, e.g. https://example.com/owncloud
  * Please take notice of the note at the end of the site if you're accessing
    your ownCloud instance via a different IP address or host name during setup
    than your users are going to use later on (or if your ownCloud instance
    should be accessible via more than one host name or IP address).
  * If you are using a self-signed certificate, you will be presented with a
    security warning about the issuer of the certificate not being trusted which
    you can ignore.

* You will be presented with the setup screen:

Required Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Under "create an admin account" you are requested to enter a username and
password for the administrative user account. You can choose any username and
password as you see fit, just make sure to remember it, you will need it later
whenever you want to configure something for your ownCloud instance.

Advanced Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Advanced settings are available for configuring a different database or data
  directory than the default ones.

* If you are not using Apache as the web server, it is highly
  recommended to configure the data directory to a location outside of
  the document root. Otherwise all user data is potentially publicly
  visible!

* Show these additional options by clicking on "Advanced":

Database choice
***************

* For a guideline on which database system to choose, and on pointers how to
  set them up for being available for php/ownCloud, see
  :doc:`../configuration/database_configuration`

* Note that you will only be able to choose among the PHP database connectors
  which are actually installed on the system.

* It is not easily possible to migrate to another database system once you have
  set up your ownCloud to use a specific one. So make sure to carefully
  consider which database system to use.

* When using MySQL or PostgreSQL you have two options regarding the database
  name and user account you specify:

  * You can specify either an admin/root user, and the name of a database
    which does not yet exist. This lets ownCloud create its own database; it
    will also create a database user account with restricted rights (with the
    same username as you specified for the administrative user, plus an
    ``oc_`` prefix) and will use that for all subsequent database access.

    * Beware that there are restrictions as to what characters a database name
      may or may not contain, see the
      `MySQL Schema Object Names documentation`_ for details);
    * Make sure to choose a name under which no database exists yet
    * ownCloud will use the provided credentials and create its own user with
      permissions only on its own database.

  * You can enter the name of an existing database and the username/password
    of a user with permissions restricted to this one database only

    * You can create such a user yourself, e.g. via phpmyadmin.
    * This user shouldn't have permission to create a database.
    * It should have full permissions on the (existing) database with the
      name you specify.


Finish Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Once you've entered all settings, press "Finish Setup"
* ownCloud will set up your cloud according to the given settings
* When its finished, it will log you in as administrative user and present the
  "Welcome to ownCloud" screen.


Note
~~~~
ownCloud will take the URL used to access the Installation Wizard and insert
that into the config.php file for the ‘trusted_domains’ setting.
All needed domain names of the owncloud server go into the
'trusted_domains' setting. No domain names of clients go there.

Users will only be able to log into ownCloud when they point their browsers to a
domain name listed in the ‘trusted_domains’ setting. An IPv4 address can be
specified instead of a domain name.

In the event that a load balancer is in place, there will be no issues, as long
as it sends the correct X-Forwarded-Host header.

It should be noted that the loopback address, '127.0.0.1', is whitelisted and
therefore users on the ownCloud server who access ownCloud with the loopback
interface will be able to successfully login.
In the event that an improper URL is used, the
following error will appear:

For configuration examples, refer to the :file:`config/config.sample.php`
document.
