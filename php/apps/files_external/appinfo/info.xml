	<description>
		This application enables administrators to configure connections to external storage providers, such as FTP servers, S3 or SWIFT object stores, Google Drive, Dropbox, other ownCloud servers, WebDAV servers and more. Administrators can choose in the GUI which type of storage to enable, and can mount these storage locations for a user, a group, or the entire system. Users will see a new folder appear in their root ownCloud directory, and then can then access and use it like any other ownCloud folder. External Storage also allows users to share files stored in these external location. In these cases, the credentials for the owner of the file are used then the recipient requests the file from external storage, thereby ensuring that the recipient can get at the file that was shared. 
In addition to the GUI, it is possible to configure external storage manually at the command line. This option provides the advanced user with more flexibility for configuring bulk external storage mounts, as well as setting mount priorities. More information is available in the External Storage GUI documentation and the External Storage Configuration File documentation.
