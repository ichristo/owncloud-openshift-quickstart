When clicked, a new text file opens in the browser and the file can be saved into the current ownCloud directory. Further, when a text file is clicked in the web browser, it will be opened and editable. If the privileges allow, a user can also edit shared files and save these changes back into the web browser.
More information is available in the Text Editor documentation.
